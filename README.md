# Project Overview 
This project involves performing CRUD operations using HTTP verbs. The CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) have been implemented through APIs, and these APIs are linked with the frontend.

# Frontend 
For the frontend, I've created a simple MVC project using .NET Core 6. The APIs are called from the controller in the MVC project, indicating a separation between the frontend and backend logic.

**#In-Memory Cache**
 In-Memory Cache Implementation One of the project requirements was to implement in-memory caching. I have successfully implemented in-memory caching and set the expiration time to 10 minutes. This suggests that data fetched from the APIs is cached in memory for a duration of 10 minutes, enhancing performance and reducing the need for repeated API calls within that time frame.

For the secuirty and other requirement, I have not implemeneted authentication, as I was busy with office routine and I thought It may effect the assesment timeline that's why I skipped that part.
